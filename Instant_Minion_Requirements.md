# Instant Minion Requirements Document

## Overview
This document outlines the mechanics and rules for generating an instant minion for use in tabletop role-playing games (TTRPGs). The system utilizes a series of dice rolls to determine various attributes, abilities, and modifiers for the generated minion.

## Dice Used
To generate a minion, roll the following dice:
- **D100**: Determines the minion's type.
- **D10**: Determines a unique descriptive trait.
- **D20 (+10)**: Determines Hit Points.
- **D12**: Determines the main ability and special skill.
- **D8**: Determines the main modifier (used for attacks, spells, and abilities).
- **D6 (+10)**: Determines Armor Class.
- **D4**: Determines the damage modifier.

## Minion Characteristics
All minions start with:
- **+0 to all modifiers**
- **Walking speed of 30 feet**

### **Additional Attributes**
- **Main Modifier (D8)**: This is used for attacks, spells, and the minion’s main ability. For spellcasting, Spell Save DC is calculated as `10 + Main Modifier`.
- **Armor Class (D6 + 10)**: Determines the minion’s AC.
- **Damage Modifier (D4)**: All minions use a `d6` for base damage unless otherwise noted.
- **Flaw**: Pick an ability other than the main one. The modifier for that ability is the negative version of the D4 roll.
